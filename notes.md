# Kubernetes

- Kurbernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system
- Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

## Main Concepts

### 1. K8s Architecture

- Cluster: set of machines (nodes) running K8s
- Node: a single machine (physical/virtual) in the cluster, running workloads
- Master node (Control plane): Manages the cluster, scheduling workloads, and maintaining the desired state
- Worker node: Runs applications (containers) assigned by the master
